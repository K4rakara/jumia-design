# Overview

Jumia is a Discord library for Rust built around a builder model that attempts to provide medium-sized bots with a very
easy framework to develop without making too much infrastructure.

Jumia will be a wrapper around another library to prevent fragmentation - but it will hopefully be an easy experience.

### Alternatives

I've looked at Poise, and I'm personally not much of a fan of the design ideas.

You could also just use base Serenity, but there is a lot of infrastructure that you have to build up before you can get
to actually implementing stuff. We hope to provide this built in.
